                        How to Plant Vegetables
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Are you a first time gardener? Learning how to grow vegetables can be a satisfying process that
                        may pay off heftily at harvest time. To begin the process, you need to learn how, where, and
                        when to plant the vegetables you want to grow. Planting vegetables requires some pre-planning on
                        your part, to insure that you start your plants off right. In addition, planting vegetables
                        requires two kinds of investments: an investment of money for seeds or starts and soil
                        amendments, and an investment of the time it takes to prepare the soil, plant the vegetables,
                        and care for them as they grow.

                        <p>
                            1. Decide which veggies to plant. Research vegetables that grow successfully in your area.
                            Your location is one of the largest factors in whether you will successfully grow
                            vegetables. You need to do a bit of research about your region and only decide on vegetables
                            that are compatible with the climate where you live. Looking up the United States Department
                            of Agriculture’s growing zones can give you a start in learning about what plants grow well
                            in your area.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Start out small. You may want to plant a ton of different vegetables but if you are just
                                starting out gardening you should really focus your energy on just a few.[2] Growing
                                vegetables can be more of a time commitment than people expect, so begin gradually so
                                you don't get overwhelmed.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Once you are an experienced gardener, you may be able to replicate the climate of other
                                regions in order to grow any vegetables you like. However, when you are just starting
                                out, planting vegetables that are difficult to grow in your region will most likely just
                                be frustrating and unfruitful.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="part1_block">

                    </div>
                </div>


                <div class="part1_head">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            2.
                            Decide where to plant your veggies. In general, choose a spot to plant your vegetables where
                            sun shines at least 6 hours a day.[3] This amount of sun is considered "full sun." If you
                            want to plant a vegetable that does not require full sun all day, then you will need to
                            locate an area of your yard that gets a significant amount of shade.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You do not necessarily have to plant vegetables directly in the ground. Planting veggies
                                in pots can be very successful for a wide variety of plants and it does not require a
                                lot of space.[4] There are benefits to container gardening, for instance you can easily
                                move the plants to a new location if they are not happy where you initially place them
                                and the soil in the pot usually develops fewer weeds. On the downside, however, plants
                                in containers usually need to be watered more often and are more vulnerable to cold and
                                hot temperatures, as a pot changes temperature much more easily than the ground.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="part1_block">
                        <img class="img1" src="step3.jpg" alt="">

                    </div>

                </div>

                    <div> <img class="img2" src="step4.jpg" alt=""> </div>

                    <div>
                        3. Decide whether to plant seeds or starts. Seeds will generally need to start earlier but may
                        have to be started inside, to protect them from frost.[5] Vegetable starts, young plants that
                        have been grown from seed in a greenhouse by a professional, will cost you significantly more to
                        buy, but they will establish easier and can be planted later in the growing season.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Some plants are difficult to grow from seed. Plants with long germination periods, such
                                as cilantro, can be difficult for home gardeners to cultivate. Consider investing in the
                                added cost of vegetable starts for plants such as this.
                            </li>
                            <li>Many plants, including lettuce, are actually easier to grow from seed. This is
                                especially the case for plants, such as carrots, that don't do well with being
                                transplanted. For plants like this, it makes sense to sew the seeds directly into the
                                ground or in biodegradable seed starting pots that can go right into the ground once the
                                plant sprouts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            4. Figure out when to plant your veggies. Part of deciding when to plant your veggies will be
                            dictated by whether you are planting seeds or starts. In addition, different vegetables need
                            to
                            be planted at different times of the year. There are many vegetables that thrive in the
                            summer
                            sun, but you can also grow a surprising amount of vegetables over the winter months,
                            depending
                            on your location.[7]

                            1.
                            Buy seeds or veggie starts from a garden center. If purchasing seeds, pick a brand that
                            seems dependable and pick vegetable strains that seem reliable. You may want to do some
                            research before you go to the garden center to decide exactly which type of each vegetable
                            you want. If you are purchasing vegetable starts, pick plants that seem healthy and do not
                            have discoloration or spots.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Consider whether you want organic or non-GMO veggie starts or seeds. While some people
                                do not have a problem with genetic modification or pesticides, others do not what these
                                kind of processes involved in the propagation of their food. It's up to you.

                            Test the soil and purchase necessary amendments. These amendments will depend on the current
                            status of your soil and the needs of the vegetables you want to plant. If you have never
                            planted before in the location you are using, take a soil sample and conduct a soil test.[8]
                            There are tests available at any garden center that will tell you the ph of your soil. Soil
                            can go from very acidic all the way to very alkaline, as well as going from very sandy to
                            very clay like. Figure out what kind of soil you have and try to move it more toward neutral
                            by adding amendments.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            3.
                            Remove all of the weeds and vegetation where you are going to plant your vegetables. Take
                            the time to weed before you plant your veggies. Weeds will compete for nutrients with your
                            new plants, making their success less likely. Get all the weeds from their roots, as many
                            weeds can regenerate if even a bit of their roots are left intact.

                                After assessing the soil, add some compost to it. Compost adds organic matter that
                                breaks down and basically becomes food for your plant.

                            Break up and amend the soil. You will want to cultivate, or break up, the soil in an area a
                            bit larger than where your plants will actually be. The root systems of many plants will
                            grow to be quite large, moving outward from where the plant is initially planted. You can
                            break the soil up by digging with a shovel or using a roto-tiller. As you mix the soil, add
                            in any amendments you need to add based on the results from your soil test.
                            Maybe you want grow plants from seeds to save money. It’s definitely cheaper than buying transplants.  It will also be easier to find seeds of varieties not typically available for sale as transplants. Whatever the reason, starting plants from seeds is probably not a hard as you think. And growing plants all the way from seed to maturity is one of gardening’s most rewarding endeavors.
                            Seed-starting containers should be clean, measure at least 2-3 inches deep and have drainage holes. They can be plastic pots, cell packs, peat pots, plastic flats, yogurt cups, even eggshells.  As long as they are clean (soak in a 9 parts water to one part household bleach for 10 minutes), the options are endless. You can also buy seed-starting kits, but don't invest a lot of money until you're sure you'll be starting seeds every year. If you start seeds in very small containers or plastic flats, you'll need to transplant seedlings into slightly larger pots once they have their first set of true leaves

                        1.
                        Dig a hole and place seeds or a vegetable start in it. Be sure to follow any directions on seed
                        packets about how deep and how far apart you should plant seeds. Some seeds can easily grow from
                        a depth of 6 inches, while others need to basically be on the surface of the soil. Vegetable
                        starts, on the other hand, should be planted so that their existing soil is level with the
                        surface.

                                Remember that some plants can only grow in one direction, meaning that a certain part of
                                the seed or clove needs to be facing up in order for it to grow properly. For instance,
                                garlic cloves have a top and bottom. When planting garlic you need to face the pointy
                                side up in order for it to grow.

                        Cover the hole back up with soil. If you are using seeds, pack the soil back in the hole, making
                        sure that it is firm but not totally compacted. If you are planting vegetable starts, push soil
                        in all around the start, pressing the soil firmly so that the start stands firmly upright.

                        Water your vegetables. The first time you water, you will want to soak the entire area. After
                        that, keep the soil moist but don't drown the plants. Keeping up on watering is one of the most
                        important things you can do to make your vegetables thrive. Monitor your plants and soil and
                        adjust your watering schedule accordingly.

                                If you are starting plants from seeds outdoors, keep the water consistently moist until
                                the plants come up. As they grow, you can reduce the watering frequency to once or twice
                                per week.

                        Care for your veggies after planting. Don't just forget about them, or they won't grow very
                        well. Remove any weeds that pop up, fertilize if necessary, and keep on watering.[10] You will
                        need to keep tending to your veggies but once they are planted properly, much of your work is
                        done!

                                To deter weeds from growing, consider mulching around your veggies.[11] The little bit of effort it takes to mulch will pay off when you are not repeatedly weeding around your plants.

                                Some vegetable plants need to be fertilized during the growing season to ensure harvest because they absorb large amounts of nutrients from the soil. Make sure that you’re aware of your plants’ specific feeding requirements.
